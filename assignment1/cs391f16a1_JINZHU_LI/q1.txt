// Is the database normalized?

Answers:

I think the database is not normalized for several reasons, for example,
1. table "routes" does not have primary key;
2. in each table, there are some redundant data, ie. has duplicate data for one item,
	which can be separate into smaller table for example "country", "city";
3. has some inappropriate data for example "Airline_ID" in table "routes" can be '\N';
